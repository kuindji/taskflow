# Handoff: adoptions from t3code

Keep this file short. It is the only state carried between sessions. Update the row and add facts the next step needs. Don't add narrative.

Plan: `../2026-10-30-t3code-adoptions.md`. Design: `design.md`. Chain protocol: `chain.md`.

## Next step

Plan review round 3.

## Facts for the next step

- Base commit before implementation (final-review base): not recorded yet. The Section 1 session records it.
- Implementation waits for the agent-browser chain (`../2026-10-30-agent-browser/handoff.md`, Next step "None: complete"). Plan reviews don't.
- **Push order:** the agent-browser feature's `/cdp/` upgrade (`ws/server.ts`) and `/api/browser/*` routes are as unauthenticated as the rest of the API until Section 5 here enforces auth. Tell the user not to push the browser work separately before Section 5, unless they accept that.
- The agent-browser plan already took the browser-specific t3code lessons (commit `38523814`, its spec Amendment 12). Don't redo them here.
- t3code source: fetch commit `32ecd71726fee16f335484c1f95cbce126d461f6` into your scratchpad with the command in `design.md` (the short SHA can't be fetched).
- Round 3 brief: check that round 2's fixes hold (`reviews/round-2-triage.md` lists them; S2, S3, S4, S6, S9, S13 changed, design.md didn't), and look for new problems. This is the last round: a confirmed blocker or major in round 3 stops the chain (chain.md round cap).
- Round 2 fixes most worth re-checking: primary restore in `attach` (S3 Task 3.3, `connection-registry.ts` `closeConnection` clears `primaryId`); async `getSnapshot` and its three callers/fakes (S6 Task 6.1).
- The agent-browser chain has uncommitted edits in `packages/ui/src/stores/backend-store.ts` and other UI files. Line anchors there may shift; sections say to find code by landmarks.
- `bun test packages/ui` run as one command has pre-existing failures from `mock.module` leakage. Judge UI tests file by file.
- Tests asserting rejections use `expectRejects` from `packages/backend/tests/expect-rejects.ts`.
- Shell is zsh: `$F` file lists don't word-split. Pass files to eslint and prettier explicitly.

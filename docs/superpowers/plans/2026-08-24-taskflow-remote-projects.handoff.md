with the deltas listed in this plan. Delete in-tree repros as listed in the plan's
"Notes for the executor" when their task lands.

## Review round results

(none yet)

## Decisions taken

- Commits follow the project CLAUDE.md: no Co-Authored-By trailer.
- Task 1: `packages/backend/src/index.ts` already fails `prettier --check` at the
  plan baseline (the `SYSTEM_CLIENTS` registration); left as is, not part of this task.

## Validation baseline

Full `bun test` at `e7a226c`: 1243 pass, 10 fail. All ten are the known
mock.module-leak family: `wiki-backend-collision.repro.test.ts` (1),
`MarkdownPaneImpl.anchors` (3), `MarkdownPaneImpl.checkbox` (5),
`MarkdownPaneImpl.rerender` (1; passes when run alone). Treat these as baseline.
`bun run typecheck` clean.

## Next step

Next step: review round 1 of Task 1 (diff `6978606..e7a226c`).

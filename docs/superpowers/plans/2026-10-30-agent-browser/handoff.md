# Handoff: Agent-Drivable Internal Browser

Keep this file short. It is the only state carried between sessions. Update the row and add facts the next section needs. Don't add narrative.

Plan: `../2026-10-30-agent-browser.md`. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-30-agent-browser-cdp-design.md`. Chain protocol: `chain.md`.

## Next step

Plan review round 1.

## Facts for the next section

- Base commit before implementation (final-review base): not recorded yet. The Section 2 session records it.
- Spike facts (Section 1 fills these in): debug port source; hidden-view rendering method; `createWindow` + `window.opener`; CDP method list with decisions; `Target.createTarget` behavior.
- `bun test packages/ui` run as one command has pre-existing failures from `mock.module` leakage. Judge UI tests file by file.
- Tests asserting rejections use `expectRejects` from `packages/backend/tests/expect-rejects.ts`.
- Shell is zsh: `$F` file lists don't word-split. Pass files to eslint and prettier explicitly.
- `electron/package.json` may carry an uncommitted version bump by the user. Don't commit it.

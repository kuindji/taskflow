## Review rounds

### Task 1 — round 1 (2026-08-13)

- Reviewer: gpt-5.5 via `codex exec` (Mode B, prompted review over `e72babf..ecafa5d`,
  code files only — plan/handoff doc changes excluded from the diff).
- Result: **clear — zero findings.** No fix commit; HEAD stays `ecafa5d`.
- Reviewer traced every `saveFlow` caller (HTTP route `flow-routes.ts:182`, WS handler
  `handlers/flow.ts:48`, UI `FlowManagementDialog.tsx:86` via the UI flow store, and both
  CLIs). None currently emits a non-boolean `loop`, so the new validation rejects nothing
  that previously worked.
- Verified independently by Claude:
  - `assertValidFlowDefinition` runs on **load** too (`flow-store.ts:137-139` inside
    `getFlows`), not only on save. Harmless now — no persisted definition carries `loop` —
    but it means a hand-edited `definitions.json` with `"loop":"false"` breaks *reads* of
    every flow, not just that one. Worth remembering if Task 8/10 ever writes the flag as
    a string.
  - `bun test packages/backend/src/services/__tests__/flow-store.test.ts` → 19 pass, 0 fail.
  - `bun run typecheck` → all four packages exit 0 (this is what covers the positive test,
    which `bun test` cannot fail on since it does not typecheck).
  - `git status` clean after both runs.

### Task 2 — implementation (2026-08-13)

- Base commit `c505881`; implementation commit `75534e4`.
- Step 1 characterisation tests added to `flow-runner.test.ts` (`describe("stopFlow — non-looped
  behaviour is preserved")`). Verified green **before** the extraction (22 pass / 0 fail) and
  again after — that is what makes this a genuine pure refactor rather than an assumed one.
- `endRun` + `EndRunOptions` added to `flow-runner.ts`; `failFlow` now delegates to it.
  `FlowActionStatus` added to the shared type import.
- One intentional ordering change carried over from the plan: `sessionFlowMap.delete` now runs
  *before* `closeSession` (old code closed first). Safe because the PTY exit is asynchronous,
  and delete-first is the ordering Tasks 5–7 rely on.
- Validation: `bun test packages/backend/src/services/__tests__/` → 53 pass, 0 fail (4 files).
  `bun run typecheck` → all four packages exit 0. `git status` clean apart from the handoff.

## Decisions taken

- 2026-08-13: `bun run format:check` reports a pre-existing warning on
  `packages/ui/src/lib/fuzzy-match.test.ts`. It is unrelated to this plan and was
  already dirty-formatted at base commit `e72babf`. Left untouched; do not treat it
  as a regression in later tasks. If Task 12 requires a clean `format:check`, fix it
  there as a separate one-line commit.
- 2026-08-13: Task 1 is a type + validation change with real behavioural effect
  (`saveFlow` now rejects a payload it used to accept), so it gets a review round
  rather than being skipped as trivial.
- 2026-08-13: Task 2 gets a review round rather than being skipped as trivial. It is
  labelled a pure refactor, but it rewrites the run-ending path that stop, fail, and
  (soon) `completeFlow` all share, and it deliberately reorders the session teardown.
  That is exactly the kind of change where "no behaviour change" needs checking, not
  asserting.

## Next step

Next step: Task 2 review round 1 — one gpt-5.5 review via the `codex-review` skill over
`c505881..75534e4` (code files only; exclude the handoff doc). Verify any findings
independently before acting on them, fix the substantiated ones, validate with
`bun test packages/backend/src/services/__tests__/` plus `bun run typecheck`, and commit.
Zero substantiated findings → Task 2 is clear and the next step is implementing Task 3
(serialize the runner's public mutators under the owner lock). Note for that review: the
delete-before-close reordering inside `endRun` is intentional and specified by the plan.

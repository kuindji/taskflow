# Flow Loops — Implementation Handoff

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-taskflow-flow-loops.md`

This document is the source of truth for progress. One bounded step per session.

## Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Base commit | Notes |

| 2 | Extract `endRun` (pure refactor) | pending | — | |
| 3 | Serialize runner public mutators under owner lock | pending | — | |
| 4 | Snapshot `loop` onto run, wrap around | pending | — | |
| 5 | Stop completes a looped run | pending | — | |
| 6 | Close session when a looped step completes | pending | — | |
| 7 | `completeFlow` and its route | pending | — | |
| 8 | CLI — `flow complete` and `--loop` on `flow create` | pending | — | |
| 9 | Tell the agent it is in a loop | pending | — | |
| 10 | Flow editor — loop toggle | pending | — | |
| 11 | Flow panel — iteration indicator, loop-aware stop | pending | — | |
| 12 | Full verification | pending | — | Includes manual E2E — likely a user gate |

## Review rounds

### Task 1 — round 1 (2026-08-13)

- Reviewer: gpt-5.5 via `codex exec` (Mode B, prompted review over `e72babf..ecafa5d`,
  code files only — plan/handoff doc changes excluded from the diff).
- Result: **clear — zero findings.** No fix commit; HEAD stays `ecafa5d`.
- Reviewer traced every `saveFlow` caller (HTTP route `flow-routes.ts:182`, WS handler
  `handlers/flow.ts:48`, UI `FlowManagementDialog.tsx:86` via the UI flow store, and both
  CLIs). None currently emits a non-boolean `loop`, so the new validation rejects nothing
  that previously worked.
- Verified independently by Claude:
  - `assertValidFlowDefinition` runs on **load** too (`flow-store.ts:137-139` inside
    `getFlows`), not only on save. Harmless now — no persisted definition carries `loop` —
    but it means a hand-edited `definitions.json` with `"loop":"false"` breaks *reads* of
    every flow, not just that one. Worth remembering if Task 8/10 ever writes the flag as
    a string.
  - `bun test packages/backend/src/services/__tests__/flow-store.test.ts` → 19 pass, 0 fail.
  - `bun run typecheck` → all four packages exit 0 (this is what covers the positive test,
    which `bun test` cannot fail on since it does not typecheck).
  - `git status` clean after both runs.

## Decisions taken

- 2026-08-13: `bun run format:check` reports a pre-existing warning on
  `packages/ui/src/lib/fuzzy-match.test.ts`. It is unrelated to this plan and was
  already dirty-formatted at base commit `e72babf`. Left untouched; do not treat it
  as a regression in later tasks. If Task 12 requires a clean `format:check`, fix it
  there as a separate one-line commit.
- 2026-08-13: Task 1 is a type + validation change with real behavioural effect
  (`saveFlow` now rejects a payload it used to accept), so it gets a review round
  rather than being skipped as trivial.

## Next step

Next step: implement Task 2 — extract `endRun` from `failFlow` in
`packages/backend/src/services/flow-runner.ts`. Record HEAD as its base commit first.
This is a pure refactor: the Step 1 characterisation tests must pass **before** the
extraction as well as after. Task 2 then needs its own review round 1.
